# ðŸ“Š SPARC Project Status

**System Status Overview**

Let me check your project status and system health...

I'll examine the current project configuration and provide a comprehensive status report including:

## Project Information
- Project name and namespace
- Current directory and configuration
- Last activity and development phase

## Memory & Context Status
- **Vector Database (Qdrant)** - Codebase embeddings and semantic search
- **Context Database (Supabase)** - Project memory and agent communications
- **Namespace Isolation** - Ensures no cross-project contamination

## Agent System Health
- Active agent count and status
- Recent agent activities
- System infrastructure status

## Development Progress
- Current phase and completion status
- Recent milestones and achievements
- Pending tasks and next steps

## Available Commands

- Continue describing your project goals naturally
- `/phase` - Check current development phase
- `/agents` - Show active agents  
- `/sparc [goal]` - Enter SPARC development mode

*All data is isolated by namespace - no cross-project contamination.*
