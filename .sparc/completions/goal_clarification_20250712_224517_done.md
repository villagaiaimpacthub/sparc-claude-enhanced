## Next Phase Recommendation
Ready to proceed to **Technical Specification Phase** with high confidence.

## Context for Next Agent
- **Refined Goal**: Build a production-ready system that: I want to build a REST API for user management. It should handle user registration, login, profile updates, and user data retrieval. The API should support 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms. I prefer Python with FastAPI framework. Security is important - need proper authentication and data validation. Planning to deploy on AWS. Technical requirements: using Python/FastAPI, deployed on AWS.
- **Primary Intent**: Build production-ready system
- **Key Preferences**: 
- **Critical Constraints**: Security, performance, maintainability
