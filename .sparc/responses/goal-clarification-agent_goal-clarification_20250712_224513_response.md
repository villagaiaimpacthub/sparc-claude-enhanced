## Selected Answer
Option 1: CRUD operations for user management (GET /users, POST /users, PUT /users/{id}, DELETE /users/{id})

## Answer Details
I want the API to support complete user management operations:
- GET /users - List all users (paginated)
- GET /users/{id} - Get specific user details
- POST /users - Create new user (registration)
- PUT /users/{id} - Update user profile
- DELETE /users/{id} - Remove user account

Additionally, I need authentication endpoints:
- POST /auth/login - User authentication
- POST /auth/refresh - Token refresh
- DELETE /auth/logout - User logout

## Additional Context
- API should return JSON responses
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Support pagination for user lists
- Include proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- Validate all input data for security
- Support 1000+ concurrent users with sub-200ms response times
