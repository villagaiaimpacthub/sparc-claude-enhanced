**Execution Mode**: Perfect Prompt with Complete Context Awareness

## 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Create comprehensive implementation documentation

### 🎯 AI-VERIFIABLE OUTCOMES REQUIRED
- Every requirement has specific success criteria
- All success criteria are quantifiable

### 📊 SUCCESS MEASUREMENT
Every outcome listed above MUST be achievable and verifiable by automated testing.

## 🧠 COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT

### 💬 User Conversation History
**Q1**: Unknown question
**A1**: [Pending response]

**Q2**: Unknown question
**A2**: [Pending response]

**Q3**: Unknown question
**A3**: [Pending response]

## ✅ AI-VERIFIABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA

### 1. Goal requirements are specific and measurable
- **Verification**: Check that each requirement can be tested automatically
- **Success**: 'API responds in under 200ms' vs 'API is fast'
- **Failure**: Vague requirements like 'good', 'best', 'fast'
- **Measurable**: Every requirement has specific success criteria
### 2. Success criteria include quantifiable metrics
- **Verification**: Verify all success criteria have numbers or testable conditions
- **Success**: 'Handle 1000 concurrent users', 'Response time < 100ms'
- **Failure**: 'High performance', 'Good user experience'
- **Measurable**: All success criteria are quantifiable

### 🔍 Glass Box Verification Points
