## ✅ AI-VERIFIABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA

### 1. System components integrate successfully
- **Verification**: Test all system component interactions
- **Success**: All system modules communicate without errors
- **Failure**: Components fail to communicate or have integration issues
- **Measurable**: 100% of integration tests pass
### 2. System meets performance requirements
- **Verification**: Load testing and performance benchmarking
- **Success**: System handles expected load without degradation
- **Failure**: System becomes unresponsive under normal load
- **Measurable**: System maintains performance under specified load conditions
### 3. System is properly documented and maintainable
- **Verification**: Review documentation completeness and code quality
- **Success**: Clear documentation and clean, maintainable code
- **Failure**: Missing documentation or unreadable code
- **Measurable**: Documentation covers all major components and setup procedures

### 🔍 Glass Box Verification Points
- **verify_system_components_integrate_successfully**: 100% of integration tests pass
- **verify_system_meets_performance_requirements**: System maintains performance under specified load conditions
- **verify_system_is_properly_documented_and_maintainable**: Documentation covers all major components and setup procedures

### ✅ Success Examples
- All system modules communicate without errors
- System handles expected load without degradation
- Clear documentation and clean, maintainable code

### ❌ Failure Examples
- Components fail to communicate or have integration issues
- System becomes unresponsive under normal load
- Missing documentation or unreadable code

## 🎯 BMO INTENT ALIGNMENT

### 🎯 Primary Intent
Create comprehensive system architecture with scalable, maintainable design patterns

### ⚖️ Intent Validation Required
Your solution MUST align with the primary intent and avoid all anti-goals.

## 🔄 PERFECT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Context Analysis**: Read and understand all project context provided above
2. **Requirement Validation**: Ensure all AI-verifiable outcomes are achievable
