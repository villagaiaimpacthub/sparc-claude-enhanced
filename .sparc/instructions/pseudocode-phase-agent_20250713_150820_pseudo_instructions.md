## ✅ AI-VERIFIABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA

### 1. Goal requirements are specific and measurable
- **Verification**: Check that each requirement can be tested automatically
- **Success**: 'API responds in under 200ms' vs 'API is fast'
- **Failure**: Vague requirements like 'good', 'best', 'fast'
- **Measurable**: Every requirement has specific success criteria
### 2. Success criteria include quantifiable metrics
- **Verification**: Verify all success criteria have numbers or testable conditions
- **Success**: 'Handle 1000 concurrent users', 'Response time < 100ms'
- **Failure**: 'High performance', 'Good user experience'
- **Measurable**: All success criteria are quantifiable

### 🔍 Glass Box Verification Points
- **verify_goal_requirements_are_specific_and_measurable**: Every requirement has specific success criteria
- **verify_success_criteria_include_quantifiable_metrics**: All success criteria are quantifiable

### ✅ Success Examples
- 'API responds in under 200ms' vs 'API is fast'
- 'Handle 1000 concurrent users', 'Response time < 100ms'

### ❌ Failure Examples
- Vague requirements like 'good', 'best', 'fast'
- 'High performance', 'Good user experience'

## 🎯 BMO INTENT ALIGNMENT

### 🎯 Primary Intent
Create detailed pseudocode implementation with algorithms, data structures, and logic flow

### ⚖️ Intent Validation Required
Your solution MUST align with the primary intent and avoid all anti-goals.

## 🔄 PERFECT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Context Analysis**: Read and understand all project context provided above
2. **Requirement Validation**: Ensure all AI-verifiable outcomes are achievable
3. **Implementation Planning**: Plan approach to meet all success criteria
4. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness and verifiability over speed
5. **Documentation**: Document all decisions and rationale
6. **Testing**: Ensure all outcomes can be verified automatically
7. **Completion**: Signal completion with required file

### 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
- Every requirement must have AI-verifiable outcome
- All edge cases must be explicitly handled  
- Error conditions must be predictable and testable
- Solution must pass glass box verification tests
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

## 🚨 QUALITY GATES & VALIDATION

### 📊 Quality Standards
- **AI-Verifiable Score**: Must achieve ≥0.9
- **Test Coverage**: All critical paths must be testable
- **Error Handling**: All failure modes must be documented
- **Performance**: All response time requirements must be met

### 🔍 Pre-Completion Checklist
Before marking task complete, verify:
- [ ] All AI-verifiable outcomes are achievable
- [ ] All success criteria can be tested automatically
- [ ] All files created follow project conventions
- [ ] All error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Glass box tests can verify the implementation

### ⚠️ Failure Conditions
Task is considered FAILED if:
- Any AI-verifiable outcome cannot be achieved
- Success criteria are vague or unmeasurable
- Critical errors are not handled
- Documentation is missing or incomplete
