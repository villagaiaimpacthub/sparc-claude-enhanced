# SPARC Autonomous Development

Activate the 36-agent autonomous development system for complete software project creation.

## Usage

```
/sparc "Build a REST API with user authentication"
/sparc "Create a React dashboard with real-time data"
/sparc "Develop a CLI tool for file processing"
```

## What This Does

1. **Specification Phase**: Analyzes requirements, defines scope, creates detailed specs
2. **Architecture Phase**: Designs system structure, components, and data flow
3. **Pseudocode Phase**: Creates implementation plans with detailed algorithms
4. **Refinement Phase**: Generates production code, tests, and documentation
5. **Completion Phase**: Validates, optimizes, and prepares for deployment

## Features

- **36 Specialized Agents**: Each handling specific aspects of development
- **Memory Isolation**: Project-specific namespace prevents cross-contamination
- **External Memory**: Unlimited context via Supabase + Qdrant integration
- **BMO Validation**: Behavior-Model-Oracle cognitive triangulation
- **Phase Tracking**: Complete visibility into development progress

## Requirements

- Supabase database (for agent memory and state)
- Qdrant vector database (for context storage)
- Project must be initialized with `sparc-init`

## Agent Workflow

The system automatically orchestrates:
- **Specification Agents**: Requirement analysis, scope definition
- **Architecture Agents**: System design, component planning
- **Pseudocode Agents**: Algorithm design, implementation planning
- **Refinement Agents**: Code generation, testing, optimization
- **Completion Agents**: Validation, documentation, deployment prep

Each phase builds on previous work with complete memory of project context.

## Project Isolation

Every project gets:
- Unique namespace for complete isolation
- Separate agent memories and context
- Independent state tracking
- No cross-project contamination
