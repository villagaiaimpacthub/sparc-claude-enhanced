# SPARC Autonomous Development Project

project_id: test_sparc_1752415022

## Goal
build a financial intelligence analyzer tool

## Status
- Phase: initialization
- Started: 2025-07-13T19:03:28.520008
- Agents: 36-agent autonomous system active

## Architecture
This project uses the SPARC methodology with 36 specialized AI agents:
- **Specification** → **Pseudocode** → **Architecture** → **Refinement** → **Completion**

All agent workflows are managed via namespace-isolated memory and task queues.

## Autonomous Development
Use `/sparc` commands to continue autonomous development.
The agent system will handle complete software development workflows.
