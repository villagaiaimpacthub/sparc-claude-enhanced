# Enhanced 3D Flight Simulator Graphics Specification
Generated: 2025-07-13T14:21:27.423488
Project: Enhanced 3D Browser Flight Simulator
Iteration: 2 (Learning from previous gaps)

## Previous Iteration Analysis

### What Worked Successfully ✅
- Flight physics engine with realistic forces
- Real-time control input handling  
- Instrument panel updates and display
- WebGL context initialization
- Game loop and timing systems

### Identified Gaps ❌
- Missing 3D aircraft model geometry
- No terrain or runway 3D objects
- Missing WebGL vertex/fragment shaders
- No scene graph or 3D world elements
- Only basic WebGL color clearing (no actual 3D rendering)

## Enhanced 3D Graphics Requirements

### Core 3D Rendering System

#### WebGL Shader System
- **Vertex Shader**: Transform 3D vertices, handle model/view/projection matrices
- **Fragment Shader**: Handle lighting, textures, fog effects
- **Shader Programs**: Separate programs for aircraft, terrain, sky
- **Uniform Management**: Camera matrices, lighting parameters, material properties

#### 3D Aircraft Model
```javascript
// Required Aircraft Components:
- Fuselage: Cylinder/box geometry with nose cone
- Wings: Flat rectangles with slight dihedral angle  
- Propeller: Spinning disk with blade geometry
- Landing Gear: Simple cylinder struts and wheels
- Control Surfaces: Separate aileron, elevator, rudder geometry
- Cockpit: Basic interior visible from chase camera
```

#### Terrain System
```javascript
// Required Terrain Components:
- Runway: Textured rectangle with runway markings
- Grass Fields: Large textured plane with grass texture
- Airport Buildings: Simple box geometry for hangars/tower
- Mountains: Distant low-poly mountain range
- Ground Grid: Procedural grid for reference
```

#### Camera System
```javascript
// Required Camera Types:
- Chase Camera: Follow aircraft from behind with smooth movement
- Cockpit Camera: First-person view from pilot position
- Free Camera: Debug mode for development
- Camera Controls: Mouse look, zoom, smooth transitions
```

#### Lighting and Materials
```javascript
// Required Lighting:
- Directional Light: Sun simulation with shadows
- Ambient Light: General scene illumination
- Material System: Diffuse textures, basic specular
- Fog System: Distance-based atmospheric perspective
```

### Performance Optimization Requirements

#### Level of Detail (LOD)
- Aircraft: Full detail within 100m, reduced beyond
- Terrain: Tessellation based on distance
- Culling: Frustum culling for off-screen objects
- Texture: Mipmapping and texture atlasing

#### Target Performance
- 60 FPS on average laptops
- WebGL 1.0 compatibility
- Memory usage under 256MB
- Fast loading times (<10 seconds)
