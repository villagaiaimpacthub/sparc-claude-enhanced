# Comprehensive Technical Specification

## Project Overview
# Mutual Understanding Document

## Project Goal
Build a production-ready system that: I need to build a web application that helps users track their daily tasks and goals. Users should be able to create, edit, and mark tasks as complete. Also need user accounts and data persistence. Want it to be responsive and work on mobile devices. Prefer React for frontend. Technical requirements: supporting 1000+ concurrent users, supporting 1000+ concurrent users, with React frontend.
