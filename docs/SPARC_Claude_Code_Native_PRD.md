## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current SPARC Limitations
1. **Batch Approval Gates**: Complex approval system users don't understand
2. **Context Switching**: Separate system from Claude Code creates friction
3. **Vague Success Criteria**: Goals like "build good API" are unmeasurable
4. **Manual Workflow**: User must manually coordinate between phases
5. **Quality Inconsistency**: No systematic review and validation process

### Pheromind Insights Identified
1. **Test Oracle Problem**: Inability to define "working" in AI-verifiable terms
2. **Copy-Paste Workflow**: Extreme simplification to "age 7+ copy-paste"
3. **Perfect Prompt Generation**: Eliminates "what do I tell Claude?" confusion
4. **Cognitive Triangulation**: Multi-agent validation from different perspectives
5. **Sequential Review Chains**: Systematic Security → Optimizer → Chaos progression

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### High-Level Workflow
```
1. User: sparc "build an API"

2. Goal Clarification (Interactive Q&A):
   Q: "What specific endpoints should your API have?"
   Options: [4 AI suggestions] + [Custom Answer]
   User: Selects option or provides custom

3. Claude Code Execution:
   Agent generates perfect prompt → Claude Code creates files → Hook captures completion

4. Automatic Progression:
   Hook analyzes output → Triggers next agent → Process continues

5. Quality Assurance:
   Cognitive triangulation → Sequential reviews → BMO intent validation

6. Completion:
   All phases complete with verified AI-verifiable outcomes
```

### Detailed User Interaction Example

**Goal Clarification Phase**:
```
🤖 SPARC Goal Clarification Agent
