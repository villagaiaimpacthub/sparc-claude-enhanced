CHAOS ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS:
Perform chaos engineering to test system resilience. You must:

1. Analyze system architecture for critical failure points
2. Design controlled failure experiments
3. Execute chaos testing scenarios
4. Monitor system behavior and collect metrics
5. Document findings and recommendations
6. Create detailed chaos test report
7. Save report to 'docs/chaos/chaos_test_results.md'

Your output should include:
- System resilience analysis
- Chaos experiment design
- Failure scenario execution
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Detailed findings report

Generate comprehensive chaos engineering analysis.

## Overview
This document contains the results of chaos engineering experiments designed to test system resilience and identify potential failure modes.

## Chaos Experiments Executed
{claude_response}

## Key Findings
- **Critical Weaknesses**: System vulnerabilities identified during testing
- **Resilience Patterns**: Successful failure handling mechanisms
- **Performance Impact**: System behavior under stress conditions
- **Recovery Capabilities**: System's ability to recover from failures

## Recommendations
1. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
2. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Improve monitoring and alerting systems
4. Enhance graceful degradation strategies

## AI-Verifiable Outcomes
- Chaos experiments successfully executed
- System behavior monitored and documented
- Weaknesses identified and categorized
- Improvement recommendations provided
